/*
     The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed
  data.  This version of the library supports only one compression method
  (deflation) but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same
  stream interface.

     Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
  enough (for example if an input file is mmap'ed), or can be done by
  repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter case, the
  application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

     The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

     The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

     This library can optionally read and write gzip streams in memory as well.

     The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

     The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
  crash even in case of corrupted input.

   The application must update next_in and avail_in when avail_in has
   dropped to zero. It must update next_out and avail_out when avail_out
   has dropped to zero. The application must initialize zalloc, zfree and
   opaque before calling the init function. All other fields are set by the
   compression library and must not be updated by the application.

   The opaque value provided by the application will be passed as the first
   parameter for calls of zalloc and zfree. This can be useful for custom
   memory management. The compression library attaches no meaning to the
   opaque value.

   zalloc must return Z_NULL if there is not enough memory for the object.
   If zlib is used in a multi-threaded application, zalloc and zfree must be
   thread safe.

   On 16-bit systems, the functions zalloc and zfree must be able to allocate
   exactly 65536 bytes, but will not be required to allocate more than this
   if the symbol MAXSEG_64K is defined (see zconf.h). WARNING: On MSDOS,
   pointers returned by zalloc for objects of exactly 65536 bytes *must*
   have their offset normalized to zero. The default allocation function
   provided by this library ensures this (see zutil.c). To reduce memory
   requirements and avoid any allocation of 64K objects, at the expense of
   compression ratio, compile the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

   The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or
   progress reports. After compression, total_in holds the total size of
   the uncompressed data and may be saved for use in the decompressor
   (particularly if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in
   a single step).

ZEXTERN int ZEXPORT deflateInit OF((z_streamp strm, int level));

     Initializes the internal stream state for compression. The fields
   zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the caller.
   If zalloc and zfree are set to Z_NULL, deflateInit updates them to
   use default allocation functions.

     The compression level must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between 0 and 9:
   1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives no compression at
   all (the input data is simply copied a block at a time).
   Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION requests a default compromise between speed and
   compression (currently equivalent to level 6).

     deflateInit returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not
   enough memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if level is not a valid compression level,
   Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is incompatible
   with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).
   msg is set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit does not
   perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full. It may introduce some
  output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows. deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly. If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
